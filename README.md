## Company-Introduction
<ul>
<li>A website made by following an online course</li>
<li>Vast majority of the codes I implemented by myself.</li>
<li>When I got stuck and could not find out any way to solve the problem, I took a look at the completed project's code or search online</li>
</ul>

## Why did I work on this project?
<ul>
<li>I made this website in order to improve my HTML, CSS and JS skills</li>
</ul>

## What did I learn from this project?

⋅⋅Difference between children and childNodes, parentElement and parentNodes
<li>Nice effect by using **transform:scale()** and **transform-origin**
    <ul>
        <li>applied: team section => about me after clicking the button top-right</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Css <mark>shape-outside</mark> property. (letting content to wrap around the objects)
    <ul>
        <li>applied: team section => about me => first letter</li>
        <li>firefox has nice visualization for shape-outside property</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Usage of <mark>display:flow-root</mark>
    <ul>
        <li>applied: team section => about me. Because the first letter of the text has <mark>float:left</mark> property</li>
        <li>it enables the the container to <mark>clear floats</mark></li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Flipable card eseential properties
    <ul>
        <li>applied: customer section</li>
        <li>flipable card container(parent) - must have  <mark>perspective()</mark> value</li>
        <li>flipable card - must have <mark>transform-style:preserve-3d</mark></li>
        <li>flipable card front face - must have <mark>backface-visibility:hidden</mark></li>
        <li>flipable card back face - must have <mark>backface-visibility:hidden</mark></li>
    </ul>   
</li>
<li>Usage of <mark>em</mark> unit
    <ul>
        <li>applied: team and customer section => each team member and customer</li>
        <li>firefox has nice visualization for shape-outside property</li>
    </ul>
</li>Some <mark>web-accessibility</mark> ideas
    <ul>
        <li>applied: tab-index, aria-required, aria-label, alerts for contact form</li>
        <li>webaim.org</li>
    </ul>
<li>


## How did I do this?
